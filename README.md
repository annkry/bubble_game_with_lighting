# bubble_game_with_lighting
Rendering with lighting and transparency, as well as applying 3D transformations using standard transformation matrices (using OpenGL).

I consider a three-dimensional cubic/rectangular aquarium, from which bubbles of random sizes from a fixed range are generated at random points on the bottom. The bubbles rise at a constant speed and increase in size. The program will create a game where the player must move through the aquarium from the center of one wall to the opposite one, avoiding touching the bubbles. After passing through the aquarium, the next level is rendered, where the number of generated bubbles is greater. The game continues until the player collides with a bubble, then we display the points.

Controls:

Controlled by the keyboard and mouse.
The player can be moved with right/left/front/back arrows, as well as up/down: W/S keys (it can also be an increase/decrease in player speed, if we assume a certain inertia of the player).
In addition, we allow changing the direction of looking/moving through rotations (using the mouse, for example, arcball, which can also be from the keyboard). It is also necessary to be able to adjust the viewing angle (zoom) so that the player can choose the optimal one for himself, which we implement with the +/- keys.
Rendering:

Views: cyclically switched from the observer's perspective with the tab key to the view from outside the aquarium.
Bubbles are different-colored spheres illuminated by light.
There will be a point lighting from above the aquarium, that is, one main light source.
The player also will be displayed as a sphere of a pink color.
Rendering multiple bubbles as instances of the same object will be implemented.
There will be also visible a simulation of imperfectly transparent aquarium water as slightly blue.

GAME DESCRIPTION - controlled by the keyboard and mouse:

 - the direction of view is indicated by the movement of the mouse.
 - O/K turns on/off the alternative lighting mode, where the ceiling illuminates the balls from above in blue, while the bottom of the aquarium illuminates from below in yellow
 - TAB switches 1) from the pawn-observer view to a view parallel to one of the walls of the aquarium 2) from the parallel view to the observer's perspective view
 - A/Z moves the pawn forward/backward in the direction of view
 - R/F increases/decreases the speed of pawn movement
 - P/L turns on/off the mode where the balls are transparent (works also as the pawn moves)
 - up/down/left/right arrows allow us to change the direction of view
 - SHIFT + "="/SHIFT + "-" increases/decreases the zoom for the pawn view

GAME DESCRIPTION - rules:
The game consists of moving as quickly as possible to the opposite wall without being hit by any of the balls.
However, there are balls that glow intensely in color, which give an additional 3 points added to the final score.
The pawn we move will glow intense pink, allowing us to better see nearby balls that it illuminates.
The game will have two levels, where in the second level the maximum speed of the balls will be increased and there will be more balls.
